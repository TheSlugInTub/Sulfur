I made the project initially in C, but C gets me mad so I reset the project in C++.
Yaps about why I made the compiler and rants about C++ and reflection.
Yaps about compilers.
Yaps about lexing.
I made a lexer which lexes tokens. [Rewrite]
There will be 4 basic variable types, int, char, float and double much like in C.
Yaps about the lexer.
I then started work on the parser which converts the tokens into a data structure called an abstract syntax tree.
Yaps about ASTs.
I only finished the ast for the exit statement though, I'll make more once I have assembly output ready.
